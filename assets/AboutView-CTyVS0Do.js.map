I wanted to make this web app as\n      a personal app with features that I wanted to have when I started learning\n      Chinese. And I am using as well. While using it I thought it would be\n      better if other chinese learner could also use it. So I made it a public\n      app.\n      <br /><br />Have fun learning chinese using this app.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n.about {\n  /* max-width: 800px; */\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 2rem;\n}\n</style>\n"],"names":["_sfc_render","_ctx","_cache","_openBlock","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_createElementVNode","_createTextVNode"],"mappings":"iGACE,SAAAA,EAAAC,EAAAC,EAAA,CACE,OAAAC,EAAA,EAAwCC,EAAL,MAAAC,EAAAH,EAAA,CAAA,IAAAA,EAAA,CAAA,EAAA,CACnCI,EAQI,KAAA,KAAA,kCAAA,EAAA,EAXRA,EAUM,IAAA,KAAA,CAAAC,EAAM,kXAAA,EAAAD,EAAM,IAAA,EAVlBA,EAWI,IAAA"}
