    <h1>About Chinese Writing Assistant</h1>
    <p>
      A tool to help learners master Chinese character writing with proper
      stroke order and beginner-friendly fonts. I wanted to make this web app as
      a personal app with features that I wanted to have when I started learning
      Chinese. And I am using as well. While using it I thought it would be
      better if other chinese learner could also use it. So I made it a public
      app.
      <br /><br />Have fun learning chinese using this app.
